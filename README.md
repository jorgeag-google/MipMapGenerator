# MipMapGenerator
Stand alone programs to generate MipMaps from an image

## MipMapGenerator
Main program that takes a single image and generate all the corresponding MipMaps
It can be done using CPU or GPU (WIP)

## ComputeShaderSample
Sample program that uses a DX11 compute shader to process one single image
it is used to experiment with the MipMap creation algorithm on GPU
